## Business Understanding

The test is structured in multiple parts, each simulating a real-world task a Data Analyst at Financial House might encounter:

1.  **Logic & Business Knowledge:** Assessing fundamental analytical thinking and understanding of the data analytics landscape.
2.  **Case Study 1 (Credit Repayment):** A high-level exercise on process, KPIs, and digital solutions for a business problem.
3.  **Case Study 2 (n8n Workflow):** A hands-on automation project to design a lead management system using n8n and AI, showcasing the ability to build efficient, low-code pipelines.
4.  **Case Study 3 (Transaction Analysis):** An in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of 2,000 anonymized bank transactions to understand customer behavior, channel usage, and identify key patterns. (Files: `bank_transactions_cameroon_...csv`)
5.  **Case Study 4 (Credit Risk Analysis):** A comprehensive analysis of 500 clients to profile financial health, assess credit risk factors, and identify the most valuable and risky customer segments. (File: `bank_clients_cameroon_risk_...csv`)

The primary objective is not just to provide answers, but to **show the work**: the logical process, the code, the interpretations, and the final recommendations.
